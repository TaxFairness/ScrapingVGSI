Rich,
I was able to get the easy one done this morning.
Attached is the map and lot to PID lookup.

I have the query for the rest all written. I just need to verify that it is working correctly.

As always applications get first priority, I have not looked at it long enough to estimate how long it will take..

As I get free time I will work on it.

It's the best estimate I can give you.

Currently our network is down so  things are going to get pushed back even further,

I was hoping for a little more precision in your response.

I don't need to know the magnitude of the effort (whether it's a five-minute job, or a multiple-hour task), but it would be totally fair for you to respond with something like, "I can have it back to you by X date..." (Or, if it was the case, "This looks like a significant project. Could we talk about exactly what you're looking for so I can be sure to collect the information you need...")


Thank you.

Hi Dave,

1) I would like to get zoning permits from 2016 to present. Most convenient format would be a spreadsheet (Excel or CSV). I'd like as many of these fields as you can provide.

Permit number
Application Date
Issue Date
Completion Date
Map
Lot
Estimated Cost
Description
Owner
Permit address

2) Would you also send an Excel/CSV file of the mapping you have for map/lot/PID?

Many thanks.

Rich
