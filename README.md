# What I know about Scraping the VGSI website

Back in 2017, I wrote a bunch of scripts to pull data out of VGSI for Lyme, NH

In April 2021, David Robbins sent me a CSV file (txcardlookup-6Apr2021) that listed all properties by their VGSI "PID" along with Map/Lot

Look at writing a Python script that uses Beautiful Soup to pull out the interesting fields. Sample code at:

Use TrimCharts as a basis for file redirection, arguments, etc.
